I am a <span class="highlighter-pen">habitual problem solver</span> and a resolute defender of <span class="highlighter-pen">accessibility.</span> I want to make human-computer interaction better for everybody, whether those interactions are in the pursuit of learning (LX) or doing (UX).

I enjoy unpicking complex problems and <span class="highlighter-pen">collaborating</span> with the humans who want to solve them.
