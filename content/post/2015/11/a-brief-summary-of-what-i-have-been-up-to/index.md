Since my last blog post I have spent some time refining some of my design artifacts. This took a good chunk of time, but it was well worth doing.

## Here is a quick rundown...

## Personae

I now have personae for academic staff, a student and a support staff person for university-x. I also have also devised a persona for an external user.

## Scenarios

I used the Task Scenario template that Richard provided to us as a starting point and developed eight scenarios for my users. These are outlined on [this page.](http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog/task-scenarios-v1-1-31115/ "Task Scenarios v1.1 3/11/15") \=

## Hierarchical task breakdown

I put this into my last post, but here it is again for reference.

The next step is to work from the scenarios to build a UML diagram. That is my aim before Friday.
