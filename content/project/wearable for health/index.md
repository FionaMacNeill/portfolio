## Background
The project brief was flexible for the dissertation research topic (MSc User Experience Design). Yet I wanted my student research to apply to a real-world problem. I pursued a question posed by a colleague who is a healthcare professional and researcher: *could wearable devices be used to support a service user's journey during the lead-up to surgery?*

## Objective
This was a feasibility project to assess the potential for a smartwatch and smartphone dual application design. Feasibility was assessed by gathering the requirements from healthcare professionals for the information and data they needed from services users. These requirements were then compared to the capabilities of smartwatch and smartphone devices. Opportunities for data collection and relational data which had not been exploited at the time of writing were identified for future development.

## Project Journey
I started with an in-depth literature review looking at both healthcare and technical applications of wearable devices.  In preparation for field work I engaged in informational interviews with contacts whom had relevant healthcare experience. A service blueprint diagram outlining the service user's journey and their touch points with healthcare professionals and services was co-created with interview participants.

Auto-ethnographical research was used to analyse the capabilities of two brands of smartwatch. I designed a survey, to gauge the attitudes of current smartwatch owners in relation to use of devices for health related purposes. The survey was distributed via online user communities, social media, and via targeted emails. The quantitative findings were presented in the dissertation and used to inform the list and prioritisation of requirements. The open-text responses were used as part of human-factors, looking at the likelihood of technology adoption and potential risks.

Alongside this I formed a research collaboration with a healthcare professional working in a relevant role in practice. As part of this collaboration I defined a research proposal as the basis for Health Research Authority ethical approval. After ethical approval was granted, I completed contextual in-depth interviews with healthcare professionals working in a surgical setting as the basis for discovering data/information requirements. Second interviews were completed with the same participants. During the second interviews user personas and the scenarios of a hip replacement and a cesarian section were used to consider the viability of the data and information from smartwatches.

## Project Outcome
As this was a speculative project the written research in the form of the dissertation was the output. The results pointed to several key areas of opportunity, these were later validated by features and sensors added to the Apple Watch and its operating system. The project received a mark of distinction.

## Feedback
The practice location where healthcare professionals had been involved in the research invited me back to present my findings. Visual design artefacts including the service design blueprint were included in a juried exhibition at the University of Brighton in 2019 (Show and Tell - The Image in Research). I was invited to present as part of a UX Brighton evening event (12/02/19).

>"...a careful combination of two different charts - a service blueprint mapping a patient's journey before, through and after surgery, matched with a mental model, which is designed to gain insight from interview transcripts...Complex information...are brought into useful arrangements for further thinking to take place. They derive from research; but they also allow research to move on from them."
